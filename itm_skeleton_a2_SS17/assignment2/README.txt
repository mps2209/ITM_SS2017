Installation/Deployment

    * download and extract the assignment zip

          o NOTE: since you will develop Java applications, you must install

          o please follow the installation instructions for your OS (see wiki)
          o you can check your java version by calling "java -version" 
                and "javac -version" from the commandline
    * call "./ant.sh -p" (Linux/MacOSX/cygwin) or "ant.bat -p" (Windows shell) 
        to get a list of all possible build goals. 
    * call "./ant.sh" to build your sources.
    * cal "./TestAssignment1.sh media/video media/audio outputFolder" (Linux/MacOSX/cygwin) 
        or "TestAssignment1.bat media\video media\audio outputFolder" (Windows shell) 
        to test your assignment. You can find a log at "AntOutput.txt".
